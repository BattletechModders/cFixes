Why can't [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] harass you about {TGT_MW.Gender?Male:his|Female:her|NonBinary:their} stupid idea?\" Apparently when {TGT_MW.Callsign} asked to speak to you privately about something 'Darius wouldn't understand', it was about the trials and tribulations of being nobility.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is {SCN_MW.Callsign}'s idea?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Something about cooling systems. {SCN_MW.Subj_C} {SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:want|Default:wants} me to use my 'connections' to get the idea to people who can implement it. And {SCN_MW.Subj} {SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:don't|Default:doesn't} believe me when I say that my birth doesn't automatically open doors like that. And even if it did, I can't waste it on bullshit.\" {TGT_MW.Callsign} gives you a plaintive look, clearly hoping for advice, or at least sympathy."
