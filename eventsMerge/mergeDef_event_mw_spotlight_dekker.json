I didn't do so hot, did I?\"\r\n\r\n\n\"You did take a big hit, Dekker,\" you say. \"Any battle you can walk away from though, eh?\"\n\r\n\r\nHe sighs. \"Yeah, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe I need a different motto than that. Do you have any advice for me, Commander? What can I do better? Do I need a different 'Mech? More training? Or am I just not cut out for this business?\""
