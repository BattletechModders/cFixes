    "Details" : "LosTech. The nickname given to experimental software that Dr. Farah Murad discovered in the Nautilus Memory Core. The code's original purpose is unclear, but it appears to be at least tangentially related to the SLDF's Space Defense System program.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Murad inadvertently unleashed the Locura on the <i>Argo</i>'s main computer, it wreaked havoc across the ship, bringing down the ship's main drive and damaging a variety of shipboard systems. She eventually managed to quarantine the Locura on the <i>Argo</i>'s secondary storage drive, which she then separated from the rest of the ship.",
