    "Details" : "The freebooters, raiders and criminals of the Periphery rarely refer to themselves as 'pirates', preferring coy euphemisms. Still, piracy is what they do, and piracy is dangerous and stamping it out is a high priority for all legitimate governments. As pirates mostly prey on unarmed merchants, when they attract more formal military attention, they're usually forced to turn to mercenaries of few scruples.",
