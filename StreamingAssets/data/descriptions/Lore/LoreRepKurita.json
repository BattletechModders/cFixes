    "Details" : "Your company's representative from House Kurita. Reynauld Yamaguchi is, in a word, an embarrassment. The only purpose to warfare, as he sees it, is to maintain the position of House Kurita and its branch familiesâ€”especially his own. On his home world, he's known for throwing lavish parties and entertaining diplomats far and wide. Scorned for his frivolities, he has been assigned as a mercenary liaison as a form of punishment, but he's adapted to the position with remarkable aplomb.",
