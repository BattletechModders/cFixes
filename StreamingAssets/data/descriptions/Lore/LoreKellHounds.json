    "Details" : "One of the most legendary mercenary companies in the Inner Sphere, the Kell Hounds were founded in 3010 by Morgan and Patrick Kell. The Kell Hounds quickly rose to prominence in the Successor States through a combination of tactical acumen, strategic brilliance, and superior technical aptitude.\r\n\r\nThe Kell Hounds continued to grow and prosper until 3016, with a climactic duel between Morgan Kell and Yorinaga Kurita of the Draconis Combine's Second Sword of Light. The fight ended in a draw after an improbable series of events prevented Kurita from targeting Kell's 'Mech. Shortly thereafter, Morgan Kell abruptly disbanded two-thirds of the Kell Hounds and consigned himself to a life of exile in a religious retreat on Zaniah. The remnants of the Kell Hounds live on under Patrick Kell, but they are a shadow of their former greatness.",
