One of our pilots was killed when their 'Mech fell over, and the last of the {TEAM_TAR.FactionDef.Demonym} survivors was able to get our 'Mech back on its feet. Now they're hoping to get it safely to their DropShip and claim it for their own. We need you to stop their salvage attempt, and bring that 'Mech down. It's still an active battlefield down there, so no telling what you'll encounter."
